# Psychic-Game

##About
the app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. The screen displays the number of wins, losses, and remaining guesses, as well as which letters have already been guessed.

##TODO: 
1. disallow repeated guesses
2. disallow guesses of non-letter keys
3. display a message upon win/loss (maybe a @keyframe animation?)
4. combine repeated lines into functions (e.g. a "rewrite()" to update wins, losses, guesses, guessed letters all at once)
